# DnDLib

TypeScript/JavaScript library and accompanying JSON Schema for Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th edition.

## Introduction

This repository holds TypeScript definitions and classes for holding D&D 5e data. Along side the classes is a folder
of JSON Schema files for validating D&D 5e JSON data. The intent of this, is to be used along side my other project
"DnDatabase", an opensource database of the D&D 5e resources in a searchable, strictly validated, easy to consume
API.
